# Fountain Protocol

Sustainable DeFi protocol on Hedera Hashgraph with membership tokens (DRIP), utility tokens (WISH), and donation recognition (DROP).

**Live Protocol:** https://peaceful-profiterole-7d59be.netlify.app/fountain-ui.html

## Token Architecture (HTS)
- **DRIP**: Non-transferable membership token (freeze mechanics)
- **WISH**: ERC-20 compatible utility token (mint/burn/transfer)
- **DROP**: NFT recognition token (unique per donor)

## Protocol Economics
- Membership: 1 HBAR → 1 DRIP
- Daily rewards: 50 WISH/day (75 with DROP bonus) 
- AutoRedeem: 1000 WISH → 1.8 HBAR (0.8 HBAR profit)

## Hedera Integration
- **HCS Topic**: 0.0.6591043 (daily snapshots)
- **Mirror Node**: Real-time balance queries
- **Network**: Testnet deployment

## Quick Start
```bash
cd docs/
python -m http.server 8000
